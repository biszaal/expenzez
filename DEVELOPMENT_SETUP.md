# 🛠️ Development Environment Setup

## ✅ **Production Status**
- **TestFlight**: ✅ Working correctly
- **TrueLayer**: ✅ Fixed in production
- **AI Assistant**: ✅ Fixed in production

## 🔧 **Development Environment Fixes**

### Issue 1: Network Error in Development
**Problem**: Development environment tries to connect to localhost backend that's not running.

**Solution**: Development now uses production API endpoints.

### Issue 2: Missing Development Build
**Problem**: Expo Go has limitations for complex native features.

**Solutions**:

#### Option A: Use EAS Development Build
```bash
# Create development build
eas build --profile development --platform ios

# Install on device via TestFlight or direct install
```

#### Option B: Use Production API for Development
```bash
# Development now automatically uses production API
npm start
```

#### Option C: Test in Simulator Only
```bash
# For UI development without banking features
npx expo start --ios
```

## 🎯 **Recommended Development Workflow**

### For UI/UX Development:
1. Use Expo Go with simulator
2. Test basic navigation and styling
3. Mock banking data for UI testing

### For Full Feature Testing:
1. Use TestFlight builds (production)
2. Test real banking integration
3. Test AI Assistant functionality

### For Banking Integration Testing:
1. Always use TestFlight (not development builds)
2. TrueLayer requires production-like environment
3. Custom URL schemes work better in TestFlight

## 🚀 **Quick Development Commands**

### Start Development Server:
```bash
cd expenzez-frontend
npm start
```

### Build for Testing:
```bash
# For TestFlight
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# For Development Build
eas build --platform ios --profile development
```

### Common Development Issues & Solutions:

#### "Network Error" in Login:
- ✅ **Fixed**: Development now uses production API
- App connects to AWS backend instead of localhost

#### "Asset not found" for icon:
- Clear Metro cache: `npx expo start --clear`
- Restart development server

#### "No development build installed":
- Use TestFlight for full feature testing
- Or create EAS development build

#### Banking Connection Issues in Development:
- Use TestFlight for banking features
- Development builds may have URL scheme issues

## 📱 **Testing Strategy**

### Development Testing:
- ✅ UI components and navigation
- ✅ Basic API calls (login, profile)
- ✅ Theme switching
- ⚠️ Limited banking features

### Production Testing (TestFlight):
- ✅ Full banking integration
- ✅ TrueLayer connections
- ✅ AI Assistant
- ✅ Push notifications
- ✅ Complete user flow

## 🎉 **Current Status**

**Production (TestFlight)**: ✅ **Fully Working**
- TrueLayer banking connections working
- AI Assistant providing intelligent responses
- All major features functional

**Development**: ✅ **UI Development Ready**
- Uses production API for stability
- Good for UI/UX development
- Limited banking features (use TestFlight for banking)

## 💡 **Best Practices**

1. **Use TestFlight for feature testing** - Most reliable
2. **Use development for UI work** - Fast iteration
3. **Always test banking in TestFlight** - Production environment needed
4. **Mock data for development** - Faster development cycle

---

**Summary**: Your production app is working perfectly! Development environment is now configured for stable UI development, with TestFlight recommended for full feature testing.
